Good Inventory Logic:
Good_Inventory = MIN(WMS_A_Stock, WMS_B_Stock)

Out Of Stock Condition:
IF SHC_Stock < 50 AND WMS_A_Stock < 50 AND WMS_B_Stock < 50
THEN Alert_Status = 'OOS'

Purpose:
Avoid false alerts by triggering notification only when both platform stock and warehouse stock fall below safety threshold.
